## DID Trustlist Specification

### DID Specifications

The common trust list specification defines the lowest common denominator format that can interoperate between all included specifications and can support the minimal required features from each specification. This includes considering the minimum security requirements that satisfy each of the specifications. It was designed taking into account the following tenets:

1. SHALL be convertible from each existing trust network's formats
1. SHALL describe a key-to-trust-anchor path for all specifications
1. SHALL be cacheable
1. SHALL be mergeable (trust list operators can integrate each other's entries)
1. SHALL be usable by all stakeholders required to verify health credentials in their operations
