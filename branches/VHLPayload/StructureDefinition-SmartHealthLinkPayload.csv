This logical model was taken from the SMART Health Link documentation <https://docs.smarthealthit.org/smart-health-links/spec#construct-a-shlink-payload> as of 30 November 2023.

A [[ SMART Health Link]] is generated from this payload according to the algorithm documented here <https://docs.smarthealthit.org/smart-health-links/spec#example-shlink-generation>.
