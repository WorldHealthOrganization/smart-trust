### Key ethical considerations  

Ethics should be an integral part of the design and deployment of a digital solution. However, policy decisions are often complex and difficult. Many different considerations will need to be made and weighed against each other. Often, the evidence is uncertain and there are many different competing ethical perspectives and positions. Evidence alone will not provide the right answer, nor will a simple set of ethical rules. Public health action requires careful judgement and acceptance of responsibility for the outcomes. A number of different ethical considerations should be taken into account, including both objectives and processes. 

 

#### Objectives 

A good starting point is to identify how the use of a digital solution can contribute to important general duties of any government through public health. Three key objectives of public health action are: 

<ol>
<li>to protect and promote the welfare of individuals, communities and the population as a whole;</li>
<li>to ensure equal treatment for all individuals and prevent or mitigate, as far as possible, avoidable and unfair health inequalities (i.e. health inequities) within the boundaries of the state; and</li>
<li>to create and maintain trust in public health activities as part of the health-care system.</li>
</ol>

The creation and use of a digital solution can contribute to each of these objectives. For example, in relation to objective 1, a digital solution can promote welfare through  the provision of digital health records enabling continuity of care by ensuring that individuals have access to their health data across facilities. Promotion of this objective also contributes to confidence in the health infrastructure of the government, benefitting the whole population. Such an outcome is an important common good – that is, a good for all that cannot be created by each individual alone. Such goods require the coordinated actions of, and support from, governments. In addition, other benefits will follow from the use of a digital solution, because of improved health and subsequent increased opportunities for individuals and communities to make their own choices and pursue their own economic and social goals. 

In relation to objective 2, equal treatment requires respecting and protecting all persons equally and acting to ensure, as far as possible, that there is no discrimination against anyone. An example of how to work towards this objective is to ensure that appropriate personal data protection safeguards are implemented. Individual health data is private information, and protections need to be in place to ensure that no individual is forced to disclose or publicly display their personal health record (PHR) to access any public area or activity (18). Such a practice and/or the lack of a PHR itself may result in the stigmatization of individuals without a PHR and may exacerbate the risk of harms. 

Another example of working towards objective 2 is to think about ways to try and achieve equity through the distribution of health resources. While a digital solution may offer a more reliable, accurate and trusted mechanism to record an personal health history, they risk exacerbating health inequities, for the following reasons. 

→ A PHR may increase digital exclusion if its application and use and requires that individuals have access to a digital infrastructure or if that digital infrastructure is too burdensome for all Member States to deploy. 

→ Individuals with geographical, financial or disability barriers may also be excluded from obtaining and using a PHR, depending on the administration process, cost and design. Ensuring an equitable and inclusive approach to the implementation of a digital solution will mean that those with greater barriers to obtaining and using a PHR are supported to a greater extent than others. 

In relation to objective 3, trust is vital to ensuring the benefits of a digital solution for individuals, communities and the whole population. For example, the provision of robust data protection measures and the use of procedural considerations, outlined in section 2.2, may contribute to the maintenance of trust in public health systems. This in turn contributes to the delivery of objective 1. Another example might be that a digital solution should only be used for its intended purpose, as inappropriate uses may result in legitimate ones being undermined. 

#### Processes 

The pursuit of the objectives above can create ethical problems. One way to mitigate this risk is by ensuring that various processes uphold important procedural values. These values, in turn, also contribute to the pursuit of the objectives above. Such values include: 

**→ TRANSPARENCY:** providing clear, accurate and publicly accessible information about the basis for the policy and the process by which it is made, from the onset – i.e. notifying the public that such a process is underway. Such a process disciplines decision-making and ensures accountability by providing a sound basis for an eventual decision that reasonable members of the public may agree with. 

**→ INCLUSIVENESS IN DECISION-MAKING:** providing opportunities for all relevant stakeholders to participate in policy formulation and design, in particular those affected, and advocates for these individuals and groups. 

**→ ACCOUNTABILITY:** providing a clear framework for who is responsible for what, and how responsibilities will be regulated and enforced. 

**→ RESPONSIVENESS:** providing mechanisms and opportunities to review and revise decisions and policies based on evolving scientific evidence and other relevant data. This may include public consultation or engagement with a wide range of experts, industries and other stakeholders so that the policies are responsive to real and perceived ethical issues and concerns. Particularly important stakeholders are those who are likely to be disadvantaged or face distinct or heightened risks with the creation of a PHR, such as individuals who are unable or unwilling to create a PHR, i.e. individuals with insecure or invalid citizenship or residency status, and individuals who may face other barriers in obtaining or using a PHR (20).
