## Onboarding Process

The GDHCN onboarding process is divided it into three main stages as per the following figure:



Figure 1: Onboarding Stages

### 1. Prepare Key Material Submission

 

To establish a connection with the Trust Network Gateway (TNG) and become a participant of the GDHCN, the participant is required to prepare their own key materials for us to onboard onto the gateway. This process necessitates technical expertise for the preparation of X.509 certificates, which are to be stored in a GitHub repository owned by the participant for submission. The page [“Guideline to Prepare Key Material”](https://github.com/) provides detailed instructions to guide technically responsible individuals through this process.


Once we have received your submission and successfully onboarded the material, we will contact you to start the next phase of testing.

### 2. Perform Acceptance Testing

After we contacted the participant about successful onboarding, a connectivity test should be the first action of the process. When connectivity is successfully established the participant should execute their acceptance tests. These acceptance tests must be performed on dedicated test environment called User Acceptance Testing (UAT) which already connects other trust network participants, that applied for onboarding.
 
The participant needs to [communicate the results] of their tests to us, a quality check about the communicated results will be carried out, so that we can check for any issues or approve their readiness for production rollout.

### 3. Go Live on Production Environment


Once the acceptance stage has been successfully completed and approved, the process to Go Live on Production Environment can commence. This involves submitting the key material targeted for the production environment (as outlined in stage 1), followed by onboarding to the production environment. The participant will be notified once the Go Live on Production Environment has been successful.
