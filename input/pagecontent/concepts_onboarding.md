#### On-boarding Process Overview

The GDHCN Secretariat manages the on-boarding process and applications of eligible GDHCN Participants to connect as a trusted party to the trust network. Prepared on-boarding records will be handed over to the GDHCN Secretariat with the request to process the technical on-boarding of the trusted party. An organizational and technical successful application results in a confirmation and the GDHCN Participant can connect to the trust network as a trusted party.
