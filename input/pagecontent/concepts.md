#### GDHCN Trust Network  
The GDHCN Trust Network is a Trust Network comprised of the GDHCN Secretariat and GDHCN Participants. The GDHCN Trust Network operationalizes Trust Domains through a Trust Network Gateway by enabling bilateral verification and utilization of Verifiable Digital Health Certificates and the utilization of Trusted Services by GDHCN Participants.

#### GDHCN Secretariat 
The WHO Secretariat serves as the operational and management leadership of the GDHCN, and in this role, the GDHCN Secretariat.

#### GDHCN Participant
A GDHCN Participant is participant of the Trust Network that adheres to the Terms of Participation and manages the necessary technical infrastructure and governance processes. GDHCN Participants are responsible for making bilateral determinations related to the utilization of Trusted Services.

See: https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-security.

#### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the trust model based on public key certificates and certificate authorities.  It is the means for publishing and distributing Trust Lists comprising the public keys that can be used to digitally verify the issuer of a Verifiable Digital Health Certificates.

####  Signing Certificate Authority (SCA)
Each GDHCN Participant maintains one or more Signing Certificate Authority (SCA), certificates of which are relatively long lived. The SCA issues public key certificates for the national, short lived, Document Signers.  The SCA acts as a trust anchor such that relying GDHCN Participants can use the SCA certificate to validate the authenticity and integrity of the regularly changing DSC certificates.

#### Holder
A Holder is an individual that has Verifiable Digtial Health Certificate in their possesion, received from an Issuer.  The Holder may choose to share the Verifiable Digital Health Certificate with a Receiver.

#### Receiver
A Reciever is a system authorized by a Trust Network Participant to receive from a Holder a Veritifable verify, and utilize the content within. 

#### Issuer
An Issuer a system authorized by a Trust Network Participant to generate Verifiable Digital Health Certificates which are provided to a Holder.   An Issuer is responsible for generating the content that is digitally signed within the Verifiable Digital Health Certificate.   In order to sign this content, an Issuer should either itself be a Document Signer or utilize a Document Signer service, as authorized by the jurisdicitonal policy.

#### Document Signer
A Document Signer utilizes the private key of a private-public key pair to digitally sign Verifiable Digital Health Certificates.  A single private key is expected to sign a large quantity of Verifiable Digital Health Certificates. The corresponding public key is referred to as a Document Signer Certificate (DSC). 

#### Document Signer Certificates (DSCs)
Document Signer Certificates are the public key certificates associated to Document Signers which are issued or recognized by the GDHCN Participant.

#### Encryption Key Certificate Governance 
The process and technical specifications regarding the management and use of encryption keys for Verifiable Digital Health Certificates, Public Key Infrastructure, and for securing connections with Trusted Services and the Trust Network Gateway.

#### Trust Domain
A Trust Domain consists of:
*	Defined use cases and business processes related to the utilization of Verifiable Digital Health Certificates; 
*	the open, interoperable technical specifications that identify or define the applicable Trusted Services and Verifiable Digital Health Certificates; and
*	a set of policy and regulatory standards describing expected behavior of GDHCN Participants in relation to operation of the Trusted Services and utilization of Verifiable Digital Health Certificates (e.g. data minimization, privacy, scope of use).

#### Trust Lists 
Universal verifier applications that support different credential standards are complicated by wide variability in format of the credential payloads, signatures, key formats, and key distribution methods. Public keys formats include x509 certificates, JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS), and DID documents. Signing key distribution methods include API gateways, hosted by issuer at a pre-defined URL, embedded in certificates, and by block-chain based resolution. Establishing root of trust by trust anchor or distributing trust list has been accomplished by API gateway, hosted URL, private dissemination and other bilateral sharing agreements.

While some variability is expected in an approach that preserves sovereignty, there are opportunities for alignment in key format and distribution for the sake of fostering interoperability. With that goal, we provide a unifying trust list format to assemble and share public key infrastructure for all credential specifications used by existing trust networks. Importantly, this format does not enforce a particular policy framework for participants of the trust network.

The GDHCN currently supports two means for key distribution of keys using trust lists
- [EU DCC API](openapi/index.html) **required**
- [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](concepts_did.html) optional

#### Trust Network
A Trust Network is a means to authenticate the encryption public keys used by participants within a network to perform encryption services, verify digital signatures, establish secure connections between systems, and otherwise make use of encryption public keys.

#### Trust Network Gateway (TNG)
The Trust Network Gateway (TNG) is the open-source software and its IT operational infrastructure, utilizing open standards, for a Public Key Infrastructure and metadata management services which is used to operationalize one or more Trust Domains.  The Trust Network Gateway can be interacted with using the [API](openapi) once a mTLS connection has been established.
