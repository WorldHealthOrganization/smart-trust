Utilization of Decentralized Identifiers Documents as profiled by WHO during the G20-Indonesia feasibility test for a federated PKI.

#### Requirements
The common trust list specification defines the lowest common denominator format that can interoperate between all included specifications and can support the minimal required features from each specification. This includes considering the minimum security requirements that satisfy each of the specifications. It was designed taking into account the following tenets:
1. SHALL be convertible from each existing trust network's formats
2. SHALL describe a key-to-trust-anchor path for all specifications
3. SHALL be cacheable
4. SHALL be mergeable (trust list operators can integrate each other's entries)
5. SHALL be usable by all stakeholders required to verify health credentials in their operations

#### DID Document
The unified format is based on the [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) specification. DIDs are globally unique identifier in the form of URIs. The URI scheme includes a method name which corresponds to a standard method by which a DID Document can be resolved. This DID Document is a structured JSON-LD which captures each existing public key (regardless of X.509 or JWK format used) by the members of a trust network in a common format. It allows additional metadata (such as intended purpose and key identifiers) to be added to existing keys with changing the underlying keys themselves​. It provides means to publish and cryptographically sign a master lists of keys recognized used by a trust network.

The unified format DID method selected is did:web, a method to retrieve DID Documents via existing web (https) infrastructure​. ​The did:web identifiers have the form `<DOMAIN NAME>:<PATH COMPONENT 1>:...: <PATH COMPONENT N>`​. Resolution is accomplished by https GET against the URL which is formed from this identifier by​ `https://​DOMAIN NAME/PATH COMPONENT 1/.../PATH COMPONENT N/did.json`. For example did:web:example.com:my:path would resolve a DID Document from the URL `https://example.com/my/path/did.json`​. Additional did methods may be supported in the future.

The DID Document itself should have:​
* an ‘id’ field which is the DID itself and represents the DID Subject, in this case the trust list
* a list of public keys within the ‘verificationMethod’ field​
* an optional signature via a ‘proof’ field​

The verificationMethod array represents the individual signing keys associated with issuers within the entity represented by the DID Subject, an includes:
* an `id` field which is a DID URL composed of the DID for this DID Document and key ID as ​DID#key
* controller of the public key, which can be current document (in case of publishing a key by a trust network member) or the source of the public key in case of an aggregator 
* the public key JWK, including the key's x509 and chain of trust to Root Certificate Authority​

The DID Document itself can be signed with addition of a ‘proof’ block containing signature details and key used for verification.
